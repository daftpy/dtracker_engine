# dtracker_engine

A modular C++ audio engine library built with [RtAudio](https://github.com/thestk/rtaudio). Designed to be used as the backend for a Qt-based audio tracker GUI.

## Core Concepts and Architecture
The engine is built with a layered architecture that emphasizes testability and separation of concerns:

- **Interface-based Design:** Core components like `Engine` and `PlaybackManager` are defined by abstract interfaces (`IEngine` and `IPlaybackManager`). This allows for easy mocking and testing.

- **Real-Time Safety:** The engine uses a custom **Object Pool** to pre-allocate and recycle audio players (`SamplePlaybackUnit`s). This eliminates dynamic memory allocation on the critical audio thread, preventing audio glitches and ensuring stable performance.

- **Sample Instancing:** The `SampleManager` separates the concept of raw audio samples stored in the cache and the instances stored in the manager. This allows hundreds of soounds in a project to efficient share thee same underlying audio data safely.

- **Component Layers:** The system is organized into clear service layers:
  - `Engine`: The low-level service that communicates with `RtAudio`.

  - `SampleManager`: Provides caching and management for all audio samples.

  - `TrackManager`: Manages the data for musical tracks and their pattern sequences.

  - `PlaybackManager`: The high-level API for controlling all playback (previews, patterns, tracks).

### Hierarchical Playback Graph
Audio playback is handled by a compositional graph of `PlaybackUnit` objects.

-   `Engine` -> owns a master -> `MixerPlaybackUnit`
    -   `MixerPlaybackUnit` -> can contain -> `TrackPlaybackUnit`(s)
        -   `TrackPlaybackUnit` -> can contain a sequence of -> `PatternPlaybackUnit`(s)
            -   `PatternPlaybackUnit` -> triggers -> `SamplePlaybackUnit`(s)

This hierarchy allows complex arrangements to be built from simple, reusable parts. A `TrackPlaybackUnit` applies track-level effects (volume/pan) to the output of the pattern it's currently playing.

## Features

- **C++17 Design** Utilizes smart pointers and move semantics when possible to prevent memory errors and improve efficiency.
- **Decoupled Architecture:** Core components are abstracted behind interfaces for improved flexibility and testability.
- **Thread-Safe Sample Managemeent:** A central manager with LRU cache provides efficient and shared access to audio data.
- **Comprehensive Test Suite:** Built with GoogleTest and a clean separation between unit and integration tests.

## Roadmap / Future Work

While the core playback engine is robust and functional, several key features are planned for future development:

-   **Polyphonic Patterns:** The pattern system currently supports one note per step. The next step is to upgrade the data model to allow for chords and layered notes.
-   **Effects Processing:** Implementing a basic effects chain (e.g., Delay, Filter) for each track.
-   **MIDI Input:** Adding support for real-time MIDI keyboard input to trigger samples.
-   **Offline Rendering:** A feature to export the final mix to a `.wav` file.
-   **Architectural Refinements:** Investigating moving the master clock out of individual playback units and into the `PlaybackManager` to handle global song-level synchronization.
